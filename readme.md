# Zephyr OS : Basic-Blinky Project for STM32F3 Discovery board

This is an introductory project for [**Zephyr OS**](https://www.zephyrproject.org/).
It helps to understand the various constituents of a typical
**Application Development** workflow for **Zephyr**.

We are using the [**STM32F3 Discovery**](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html)
board as a target for this project.
